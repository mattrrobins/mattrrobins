 Hi, I’m @mattrrobins.
 I have MS degree in mathematics and work as a mathematician in game development (utilizing C#, python and SQL).  
 
 In pure mathematics, my research interests include:
 - Invense Problems
 - Riemannian geometry
 - Lorentzian geometry (with emphasis on general relativity)
 - Geodesics
 - Cut and Conjugate Loci
 - Magnetic geodesics
 
I also have a strong interest in machine learning, specifically with deep neural networks.  In python I've lately been utilizing the following libraries:
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - sqlite3
 - matplotlib
 - scipy

A few topics that currently pique my interest include:
 - Topological Deep Learning
 - Symplectic Geometry
 - Inverse Problems in Deep Learning and Neural Networks
